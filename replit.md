## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**CRITICAL UI/UX Preferences:**
- DO NOT modify existing UI designs without explicit user instruction
- Master rates table should maintain its existing neumorphism design
- Only make changes when specifically requested by the user
- System requires Edit button to be clicked before data can be modified
- All sections must have exactly three buttons: Edit, Save, and Export
